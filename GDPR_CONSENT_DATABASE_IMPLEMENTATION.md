# 🍪 GDPR Cookie Consent with Database Storage - Implementation Complete

## 📋 **Overview**
Your CareLink application now has a **complete GDPR-compliant cookie consent system** that stores consent information in your database for **proof of user consent**. This hybrid approach combines local browser storage with secure backend audit trails.

---

## 🏗️ **What Was Implemented**

### **Backend (Django)**
✅ **CookieConsent Model** - Stores consent records for audit
✅ **Privacy-First Design** - No IP addresses stored
✅ **User & Anonymous Support** - Works for both logged-in and anonymous users
✅ **API Endpoints** - RESTful API for consent management
✅ **Admin Interface** - View and manage consent records
✅ **Automatic Expiry** - 365-day consent expiration (GDPR compliant)

### **Frontend (React)**
✅ **Enhanced ConsentManager** - Syncs with backend automatically
✅ **Cookie Banner** - GDPR-compliant consent collection
✅ **Consent Management Page** - Users can view history and withdraw consent
✅ **Debug Tools** - Browser console utilities for testing

## 🎯 **Where Consent Proof is Stored**

### **1. Primary Storage: Browser localStorage**
- **Location**: `localStorage.carelink_consent_preferences`
- **Purpose**: Fast access, user control
- **Contains**: Full consent data with timestamp

### **2. Audit Storage: Database**
- **Table**: `CookieConsent` 
- **Purpose**: Legal proof, compliance audit
- **Contains**: Consent choices, timestamps, user identification

---

## 📊 **How to Access Consent Proof**

### **For Users (Browser Console)**
```javascript
// Quick inspect consent
window.inspectConsent()

// View all local storage
window.showAllStorage()

// Export consent proof
window.downloadConsentProof()
```

### **For Administrators (Django Admin)**
1. Go to `/admin/CareLink/cookieconsent/`
2. View all consent records
3. Export data for compliance

### **For Developers (API)**
```bash
# Get consent statistics
GET /account/consent/stats/

# Get user consent history (authenticated)
GET /account/consent/history/

# Export audit data (admin only)
GET /account/consent/audit/
```

| `user_identifier` | Anonymous user tracking | Hashed, no personal data |
| `consent_timestamp` | When consent was given | Required for audit |
| `expiry_date` | When consent expires | GDPR 365-day requirement |
| `analytics_cookies` | Analytics consent choice | granted/denied/withdrawn |
| `marketing_cookies` | Marketing consent choice | granted/denied/withdrawn |
| `functional_cookies` | Functional consent choice | granted/denied/withdrawn |
| `page_url` | Where consent was given | For context |
| `user_agent_snippet` | Browser info (limited) | First 100 chars only |
| `withdrawn_at` | Withdrawal timestamp | User rights compliance |
